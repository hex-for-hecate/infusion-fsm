# Fluid State Machines

Some grades for defining finite state machines,
These are particularly useful for defining custom interaction techniques, where a series of user inputs must be interpreted modally.

## Using state machines in your Infusion project
This is TODO, but there's a demonstrator example in `example.js`.

### In Node.js

### In the browser

## Designing interactions with state machines
Stepehn Oney's [ConstraintJS library](https://github.com/soney/constraintjs) is a more full-featured state machine library designed specifically for creating novel interactions.
These two academic articles describe ConstraintJS and a Java-based precursor, SwingStates, and their uses:
 - [SwingStates: adding state machines to the swing toolkit](https://dl-acm-org.ocadu.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1166253.1166302)
 - [ConstraintJS: programming interactive behaviors for the web by integrating constraints and states](https://dl-acm-org.ocadu.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2380116.2380146)
